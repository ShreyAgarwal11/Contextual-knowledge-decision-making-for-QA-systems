83591,280471,14651,who wrote the music and lyrics for grease,"<P> Grease is a 1971 musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey . Named after the 1950s United States working - class youth subculture known as greasers , the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School ( based on William Howard Taft School in Chicago , Illinois ) and follows ten working - class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure , politics , personal core values , and love . The score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll . In its original production in Chicago , Grease was a raunchy , raw , aggressive , vulgar show . Subsequent productions sanitized it and tamed it down . The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy , peer pressure and gang violence ; its themes include love , friendship , teenage rebellion , sexual exploration during adolescence , and , to some extent , class consciousness / class conflict . Jacobs described the show 's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema , since the female lead , who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character , is instead drawn into the man 's influence and transforms into his fantasy . </P>",Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey,unanswerable,False,closed_book,"question: who wrote the music and lyrics for grease?

The song 's imagery evokes the devastation at the Gallipoli Landings . The protagonist , who had travelled across rural Australia before the war , is emotionally devastated by the loss of his legs in battle . As the years pass he notes the death of other veterans , while the younger generation becomes apathetic to the veterans and their cause .

Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( `` total work of art '' ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 .

Lomax proposed that the location of the house was then relocated from England to New Orleans by white southern performers .

Whitfield first produced the song -- an obvious anti-Vietnam War protest -- with The Temptations as the original vocalists . After Motown began receiving repeated requests to release `` War '' as a single , Whitfield re-recorded the song with Edwin Starr as the vocalist , with the label deciding to withhold the Temptations ' version from single release so as not to alienate their more conservative fans . Starr 's version of `` War '' was a number - one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1970 , and is not only the most successful and well - known record of his career , but it is also one of the most popular protest songs ever recorded . It was one of 161 songs on the Clear Channel no - play list after September 11 , 2001 . </P>",Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong,unanswerable,False,closed_book,"question: who wrote war what is it good for absolutely nothing?
